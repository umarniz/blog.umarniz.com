I try to keep my hello world far simpler than having so many dependencies on them :).

This article was primarily about building micro-services as that is something I have been extensively doing in the past few months and had to build multiple services that are coherent with a single development and communication style.

I will be doing a follow up of this post in the future when these services are being deployed to live as the challenge of on-demand scaling, load balancing and sysops is a whole different beast.
