Even though I have a lot to say, for some reason for the past few years I have never gotten around to sitting down and writing about what I am thinking and sharing with people. I admit prograammers are by instinc introverts, but to be honest I always feel for a true clean flow of ideas the medium should allow a minimum of distractions.

This is where medium has kicked in very well. The to the point layout with a clear dark grey on white is all you need to take you back to the time of paper. Nothing else, eyeing the next word and thinking the next sentence.
