Thanks for going sharing your insights on the topic, this helps get a better idea of the the inner workings of page draw and also the technical choices.

As I have built a prototype for such product myself in 2015 and stopped due to different reasons then the product itself (http://slashux.io) I am curious about the product itself and would really like to know the business side of this as well.

Did you get free users but not enough paying users? Was user acquisition generally hard or was it harder only to get paying customers? Did you get a lot of feature requests from users that gave you less focus on what to build next?

Most importantly, as this is a technically challenging product I understand it might involve too many things to build, were you able to identify by the end what you needed to build to make such a product successful?

All in all I would like to thank you guys for the honesty and openness of sharing your experiences and open-sourcing the product üëè
